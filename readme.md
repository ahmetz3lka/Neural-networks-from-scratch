## Neural Networks Learning Repository

Welcome to the Neural Networks Learning Repository! This repository is designed to guide you from the fundamentals of neural networks to advanced topics, complete with practical implementations and real-world projects.

### Overview

This repository is structured as a series of tutorials, projects, and experiments aimed at:

- Learning from Scratch to Advanced: Start with the basics and progressively explore more sophisticated neural network architectures.
- Demonstrating Library Implementations: Compare implementations using different frameworks (e.g., NumPy for basics, TensorFlow/PyTorch for advanced models).
- Building Real-World Applications: See how neural networks can be applied to solve problems such as sentiment analysis, image captioning, and machine translation.

### Tutorials

- 00_basics
  - **Neural network using NumPy** : Implementation of 2-layer basic neural network just using NumPy to recognize hand written digits.
